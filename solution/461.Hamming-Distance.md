## Problem Description
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
### Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.
### Example:
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:   
1   (0 0 0 1)   
4   (0 1 0 0)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

## Solutions  
### Analysis
Use XOR operation to get the different bits, named z. Then use z&(z-1) to delete the last 1. while z becomes 0, we can know the number of zeros
