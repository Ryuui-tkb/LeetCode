* Tag：`DP`

## Problem Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
### Example:
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]   
Output: 4   
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
### Note:
* There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
* Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) complexity.
### Follow up:
Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

## Solutions  
### Analysis
Use the DP method.
