## Problem Description
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.   
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
### Example 1: 
**Input:**
nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]   
**Output:**
4   
**Explanation:**
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
### Example 2: 
**Input:**
nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]   
**Output:**
9
### Constraints:
* 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
## Solutions
### Analysis
使用哈希表进行连续元素长度的存储。
