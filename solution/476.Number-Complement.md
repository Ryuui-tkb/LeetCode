* Tag：`Bit Manipulation`

## Problem Description
Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
### Example 1:
Input: num = 5   
Output: 2   
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
### Example 2:
Input: num = 1   
Output: 0   
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
### Constraints:
* The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
* num >= 1
* You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
* This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
