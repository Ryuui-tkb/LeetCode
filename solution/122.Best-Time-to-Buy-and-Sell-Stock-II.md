* Tag：`Array` `Greedy`

## Problem Description
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.   
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).   
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
### Example 1:
**Input:**
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]   
**Output:**
7   
**Explanation:**
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.   
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
### Example 2:
**Input:**
prices = [1,2,3,4,5]   
**Output:**
4   
**Explanation:**
Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.   
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
### Example 3:
**Input:**
prices = [7,6,4,3,1]   
**Output:**
0   
**Explanation:**
In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.
### Constraints:
* 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
## Solutions
### Analysis
寻找非递减递的子数组，子数组里的最大值和最小值之差则为利润。
