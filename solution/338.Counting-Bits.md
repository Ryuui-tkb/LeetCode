* Tag：`DP`

## Problem Description
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.
### Example 1:  
Input: 2   
Output: [0,1,1]
### Example 2:
Input: 5   
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
### Follow up:
* It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n\*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
* Space complexity should be O(n).
* Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like \_\_builtin\_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

## Solutions  
### Analysis
Use DP to count bits, dp[i] = dp[2^k] + dp[i - 2^k].
