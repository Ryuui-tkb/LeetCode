## Problem Description
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

* [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
* [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].   
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.   
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
### Example 1:
**Input:**
nums = [3,4,5,1,2]   
**Output:**
1   
**Explanation:**
The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.   
### Example 2:
**Input:**
nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]   
**Output:**
0   
**Explanation:**
The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.   
### Example 3:
**Input:**
nums = [11,13,15,17]   
**Output:**
11   
**Explanation:**
The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
### Constraints:
* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 5000
* -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
* All the integers of nums are unique.
* nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
