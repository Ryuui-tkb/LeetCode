* Tag：`Greedy`

## Problem Description
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.   
Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
### Example 1: 
**Input:**
g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]   
**Output:**
1   
**Explanation:**
You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.   
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.   
You need to output 1.
### Example 2: 
**Input:**
g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]   
**Output:**
2   
**Explanation:**
You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.   
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children.   
You need to output 2.
### Constraints:
* 1 <= g.length <= 3 * 10^4
* 0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4
* 1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 2^31 - 1
## Solutions
### Analysis
将两个数组根据大小排序，寻找当前需要最小size饼干的孩子，并寻找满足其需求的最小饼干，直至两个数组其中一个遍历完为止。
