## Problem Description
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.   
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
* Each child must have at least one candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
### Example 1: 
**Input:**
ratings = [1,0,2]   
**Output:**
5   
**Explanation:**
You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.    
You need to output 1.
### Example 2: 
**Input:**
ratings = [1,2,2]   
**Output:**
4   
**Explanation:**
You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.   
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
### Constraints:
* n == ratings.length
* 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
* 0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4
## Solutions
### Analysis
1. 从左向右遍历，如果当前元素大于左边的元素，则其Candy数比左边至少大1;   
2. 然后从右向左遍历，如果当前元素大于右边的元素，则其Candy数比右边至少大1。
