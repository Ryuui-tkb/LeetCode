## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.   
Follow up: Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]   
Output: [3,5]   
Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
### Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0]   
Output: [-1,0]
### Example 3:
Input: nums = [0,1]   
Output: [1,0]
### Constraints:
* 2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
* -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
* Each integer in nums will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.
## Solutions  
### Analysis
1. Due to find the two single number, we can XOR all numbers and get a XOR result named sum.   
2. get the last 1 from sum to make the flag number;
3. traverse the array numbers again and XOR with the flag number. Apart into two sub arrays. the result of two sub arrays is our answer.

                res[1] ^= num;
        }
        return res;
    }
