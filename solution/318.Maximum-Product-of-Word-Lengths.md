* Tag：`Bit Manipulation`

## Problem Description
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.
### Example 1:
Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]   
Output: 16   
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
### Example 2:
Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]   
Output: 4   
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
### Example 3:
Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]   
Output: 0   
Explanation: No such pair of words.
## Solutions  
### Analysis
we can use the 26 bits to save the letters which exists or not. Then compare the different mask and get the length(word[i]) * length(word[j])
