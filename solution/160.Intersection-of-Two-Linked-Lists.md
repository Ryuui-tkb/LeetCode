## Problem Description
Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.   
For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

It is guaranteed that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.   
Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
### Example 1:
![Image text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryuui-tkb/LeetCode/master/img/160_ex1.png)   
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3   
Output: Intersected at '8'   
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).   
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
### Example 2:
![Image text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryuui-tkb/LeetCode/master/img/160_ex2.png)   
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1   
Output: Intersected at '2'   
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).   
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
### Example 3:
![Image text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryuui-tkb/LeetCode/master/img/160_ex3.png)   
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2   
Output: No intersection   
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.   
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null. 
### Constraints:
* The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
* The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
* 0 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4
* 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
* 0 <= skipA <= m
* 0 <= skipB <= n
* intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
* intersectVal == listA[skipA + 1] == listB[skipB + 1] if listA and listB intersect.
### Follow up:
Could you write a solution that runs in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory?
## Solutions
### Analysis
这里的进阶要求在O(n) time and O(1) space内完成。   
指针A遍历ListA后遍历ListB， 指针B遍历ListB后遍历A。它们一定会在第一个相交点相遇。（如果不存在相交点，则可以认为相交点是最后一个空节点）
