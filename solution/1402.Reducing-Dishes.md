## Problem Description
A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.   
Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level  i.e.  time[i]\*satisfaction[i]   
Return the maximum sum of Like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.   
Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.   
### Example1:
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]   
Output: 14   
Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total Like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1\*1 + 0\*2 + 5\*3 = 14). Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.
### Example2:
Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]   
Output: 20   
Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2\*1 + 3\*2 + 4\*3 = 20)
### Example3:
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]   
Output: 0   
Explanation: People don't like the dishes. No dish is prepared.
### Example4:
Input: satisfaction = [-2,5,-1,0,3,-3]   
Output: 35
